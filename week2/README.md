Description: Week 2 CMEE bootcamp coursework and class files: Python I code scripts and data
Languages: Python 3.12.3

Dependencies: N/A

Project structure and Usage: Project follows the structured bootcamp content covered within the module with code, data, results and sandbox folders. All data to be run with python scripts should be either put in the data directory or the relative path specified in the input. All script outputs are specified and should be kept in the results folder. 
Code:
    align_seqs.py - aligns DNA sequences from a single csv input file, and finds the highest matching combination, creating a new text file with the score and result. 
    basic_csv.py - extracts species and body mass data from csv file and writes a new document. 
    basic_io1.py - opens and prints lines in input file. 
    basic_io2.py - opens and saves numbered list in a new file.
    basic_io3.py - writing dictionaries, serializing and deserializing the data from the file. 
    boilerplate.py - example python module/program with functions to test. 
    cfexercises1.py - python control flow script, testing and functions with doctests and user inputs. 
    cfexercises2.py - python module/program with functions printing hello. 
    control_flow.py - control flow example script, defining numeric functions. 
    debugme.py - debugging function specified to test python debugging. 
    dictionary.py - dictionary list comprehensions and loops exercise to extract taxa data. 
    lc1.py - list comprehensions and loops exercise extracting bird data. 
    lc2.py - list comprehensions and loops exercise extracting rainfall data. 
    loops.py - loops and conditional statement example. 
    MyExampleScript.py - example function 
    oaks.py - uses loops and list comprehensions to extract taza information. 
    oaks_debugme.py - finds the oak species (genus quercus) in the input csv file. 
    scope.py - defines functions and testing scope of global variables. 
    sysargv.py - testing sysargv module. 
    test_control_flow.py - functions exemplifying the use of control statements and doctests. 
    tuple.py - example script using tuples. 
    using_name.py - showing the use of the name and main values assigned when running a program/module.
Data: 
    bodymass.csv
