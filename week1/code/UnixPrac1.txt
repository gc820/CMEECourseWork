# Desc:  Calculates the number of lines in fasta files;
#        Prints everything from the 2nd line; 
#        Counts the sequence length;
#        Counts the number of matches of ATGC in the E.coli genome;
#        Counts the AT/GC ratio of the E.coli genome 
# Arguments: 1

#1 Count the number of lines in each .fasta file 

DIR="../data" # Define the directory 
for f in "$DIR"/*.fasta; do  # For each fasta file in the directory folder
    echo "Counting number of lines in $f"; 
    NumLines=`wc -l < "$f"` # Count the number of lines in the file 
    echo "Number of lines in file $f: $NumLines";
done 


#2 Print everything from the 2nd line of the E.coli genome 

sed '1d' ../data/E.coli.fasta 
# Deleted the first line of the fasta file from processing 


#3 Count sequence length of E.coli genome 

echo "E.coli sequence length:" 
sed '1d' ../data/E.coli.fasta | wc -c
# counts the number of characters in the input file 


#4 Count the number of matches in the E.coli sequence 

echo "Number of ATGC matches in the E.coli genome:"
sed '1d' ../data/E.coli.fasta | tr -d '\n' | grep -o "ATGC" | wc -l
 # 1d removes the first line (header) 
 # tr (translate) -d (delete) \n (new lines) from the input 
 # grep -o (only matching) looks for occurences of the exact string in the sequence and counts the length


#5 AT/GC ratio 

AT_count=$(sed '1d' ../data/E.coli.fasta | tr -d '\n' | grep -o -E "A|T" | wc -l); 
GC_count=$(sed '1d' ../data/E.coli.fasta  | tr -d '\n' | grep -o -E "G|C" | wc -l); 
ratio=$(echo "scale=6; $AT_count / $GC_count" | bc);
echo "The AT/GC ratio is: $ratio"
# Removes the 1st line from the FASTA file
# Removes new lines from the input 
# Counts the number of exact matches for A or T, and G or C
# Calculate the AT/GC ratio and prints to the terminal
